Cool Code:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python
def do_something(input):
  counter = 1
  print 'counting to',input
  for i in range (input):
    print 'counter =',counter
    counter+=1    
  print 'YAY! I counted to',input
```
Output:
```>>> do_something(10)
counting to 10
counter = 1
counter = 2
counter = 3
counter = 4
counter = 5
counter = 6
counter = 7
counter = 8
counter = 9
counter = 10
YAY! I counted to 10
```
